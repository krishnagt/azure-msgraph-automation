# File: Get-Azure-Heartbeat-Status.ps1
#
# Description:
# This PowerShell script connects to an Azure Log Analytics workspace and runs
# a KQL query against the Heartbeat table to monitor VM health status.
#
# Key Functions:
# - Connects to Azure using Connect-AzAccount.
# - Targets a specific Log Analytics workspace by resource group and name.
# - Executes a KQL query to:
#     ‚Ä¢ Retrieve the latest heartbeat from each VM within the last 30 minutes.
#     ‚Ä¢ Determine whether the VM is 'Healthy' or 'Unhealthy' based on heartbeat age.
#     ‚Ä¢ Calculate how long ago the last heartbeat was seen (seconds/minutes/hours/days).
#     ‚Ä¢ Build a simple trend of heartbeat activity for VMs containing "APHI" in their name.
#     ‚Ä¢ Join and enrich results with OS, environment, and resource details.
# - Filters for unhealthy machines and orders results by state and average trend.
# - Outputs the final results with key fields (PipelineName, Computer, Version).
#
# Use Case:
# Enables administrators to quickly identify VMs with missing or delayed heartbeats,
# track heartbeat patterns, and proactively respond to unhealthy systems in Azure.
